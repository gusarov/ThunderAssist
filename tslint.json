/*
tslint.jsEnable - enable/disable tslint for .js files, default is false.
tslint.run - run the linter onSave or onType, default is onType.
tslint.rulesDirectory - an additional rules directory, for user-created rules.
tslint.configFile - the configuration file that tslint should use instead of the default tslint.json.
tslint.ignoreDefinitionFiles - control if TypeScript definition files should be ignored.
tslint.exclude - configure glob patterns of file paths to exclude from linting. The pattern is matched against the absolute path of the linted file.
tslint.validateWithDefaultConfig - validate a file for which no custom tslint configuration was found. The default is false.
tslint.nodePath - custom path to node modules directory, used to load tslint from a different location than the default of the current workspace or the global node modules directory.
tslint.autoFixOnSave - turns auto fix on save on or off, or defines an array of rules (e.g. [no-var-keyword]) to auto fix on save. Note: Auto-fixing is only done when manually saving a file. It is not performed when the file is automatically saved based on the files.autoSave setting. Executing a manual save on an already-saved document will trigger auto-fixing.
tslint.alwaysShowStatus - always show the TSLint status bar item and not only when there are errors. The default is false.
tslint.alwaysShowRuleFailuresAsWarnings - always show rule failures as warnings, ignoring the severity configuration in the tslint.json configuration.
